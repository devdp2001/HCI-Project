                    <h1>Task/Problem Definition</h1>
			<br><p>The eLearning Commons (eLC) is the online learning management system for the University of Georgia. Students and professors use this web or mobile application nearly everyday to view course content, assignments, grades, and course updates. 
			<br><br>We found our main problem with eLC's assignment calendar. Currently, eLC's assignment calendar is positioned near the bottom of the page on eLC's homepage. This calendar is not functional in any way when interacted with on the homepage. 
			<br><br>The calendar only holds some functionality when viewed on a specific course page. To do this users must login and click multiple buttons to navigate to a specific course they are taking. Here, the user can use the calendar but only to view upcoming assignments for that specific course. 
			<br><br>We found issues with this because we realized that eLC does not afford any kind of summarized view or calendar for all courses at once. This issue forces students to manually check each course if they want to check upcoming deadlines. If a student wants to create a planner or agenda, they must check each course separately. We assume that many students are unwilling to take these extra steps - meaning that many students never create any type of planner or agenda for course assignments. 
			<br><br>A solution to the calendar issues would benefit all students by making them feel comfortable that they haven't missed any assignment updates and encouraging students to work ahead on assignments because they are able to see the deadlines ahead of time. Professors benefit from a potential solution because they would feel more comfortable that students are staying updated on assignments without needing a reminder email from professors.
			<br><br>This problem is theme-relevant because eLC is the online learning management system for the University of Georgia and has similarities to the online learning management systems at many other universities.
<br><br>7 Stages of Action Example:
<br>Goals
<br>Goal: A user wants to view all upcoming assignments for all courses on eLC.

<br><br>Execution
<br>Plan: A user logs on to eLC and looks for a convenient view of all upcoming assignments, but there is none.
<br>Specify: The user looks for other options and decides to view a specific course.
<br>Perform: The user moves their mouse to and clicks on a specific course.
<br>World: At this point, the user can see upcoming assignments for a specific course.

<br><br>Evaluation
<br>Perceive: The user sees upcoming assignments for a single course.
<br>Interpret: The user may feel frustrated that they have to navigate to each course separately to complete this goal. 
<br>Compare: The user is able to complete their goal, but would probably feel better about a simplified way to complete their goal.

                    <h1>Analysis of Existing Solutions</h1>
                        <p align = "left"> Currently, eLC has a reminder system, but it might not satisfy user needs. The current system only affords limited convenience because it only gives reminders a couple days before the assignment is due. The pros are that it is easily available to the students and gives them multiple options of whether they want the reminder sent as an email or text. The cons though, as you can see below, are that the notification system (reminder system) only allows you to get a notification if the assignment is due within 2 days. This is a problem since a lot of students want to know earlier than 2 days, whether they have assignments due, and this existing solution does not help with that. Another con is that when the users receive email notifications, they all get sent at once, so the students can get confused about which assignments are due, due to the huge clutter of emails they receive. There is also a to do list/calender that does not conveniently show the information needed. To access this you have to scroll to the bottom of the homepage and click on drop down links to even see the calender. This being said, it is hardly used by the students due to its bad design. Along with the existing solution in eLC, many students find themselves using 3rd party applications to keep track of their assignment. These 3rd party applications include Google Calender, other calender apps on your mobile device, the iPhones reminder application, and many more. The pros of this are that it is an overall good way to keep track of assignments, but once again the cons of this are the needed added extra steps that students must take by having to add them into these 3rd party applications.</p>
			<p align = "left"> The calendar solution helps with the discoverability principle. They signal to the user very clearly what actions are possible by the user on the website. This includes the calendar tab to view students upcoming assignment due dates. The reminder section also helps with the discoverability principle by having bolded words in the notifications section that helps user with and without disabilities read and find it. </p>

                    <h1>Proposed Solution</h1>
                        <p align = "left"> We discovered issues of inefficiency of Athena, elc, and other UGA web services. We discussed and focused on how these issues affect teachers, students, and admins, particularly causing the most problems for students because students rely on these services the most and there are significantly more students than there are teachers and admins at UGA. Freshmen students are affected even more by these web issues because of the learning curve of a new technology. For all students, trying to create an outline of assignments for all classes for a semester is difficult to do because on elc each class must be accessed separately. In addition, elc lacks a convenient reminder system for assignments. This system affords limited convenience because it only gives reminders a couple days before the assignment is due, which does not encourage students to work on assignments ahead of time. Also, these reminders go out around the same time for multiple assignments, which could potentially cause a student to miss an important notification. This also affects professors too because it causes them to lose extra time if they choose to manually send out reminder emails to students. We propose that students should have a clear, concise outline of assignments with due dates that are auto-created on elc. We also noticed that it is not efficient to log in to Athena due to bugs that affect sessions, causing Athena to automatically log out when visited if the user did not explicitly log out during the last session. This causes inconvenience and forces users to reload the page manually. Once logged in to Athena, students are forced to navigate through several pages to simply view the semester schedule or other important pages. These login and navigation problems affect all students. This inefficiency hinders students’ studying time and wastes time that could be spent in more beneficial ways. We noticed that elc has not been updated and has not added new features since our class started at UGA around 2019. These web services lack convenient features and cause some issues for students, professors, and admin. Although the visual appearance and certain functionalities of Athena were updated over the last year, many students agree that Athena has become less convenient and more difficult to use since these updates.</p>
