                        <p align = "left"> Currently, eLC has a reminder system, but it might not satisfy user needs. The current system only affords limited convenience because it only gives reminders a couple days before the assignment is due. The pros are that it is easily available to the students and gives them multiple options of whether they want the reminder sent as an email or text. The cons though, as you can see below, are that the notification system (reminder system) only allows you to get a notification if the assignment is due within 2 days. This is a problem since a lot of students want to know earlier than 2 days, whether they have assignments due, and this existing solution does not help with that. Another con is that when the users receive email notifications, they all get sent at once, so the students can get confused about which assignments are due, due to the huge clutter of emails they receive. There is also a to do list/calender that does not conveniently show the information needed. To access this you have to scroll to the bottom of the homepage and click on drop down links to even see the calender. This being said, it is hardly used by the students due to its bad design. Along with the existing solution in eLC, many students find themselves using 3rd party applications to keep track of their assignment. These 3rd party applications include Google Calender, other calender apps on your mobile device, the iPhones reminder application, and many more. The pros of this are that it is an overall good way to keep track of assignments, but once again the cons of this are the needed added extra steps that students must take by having to add them into these 3rd party applications.</p>
			<p align = "left"> The calendar solution helps with the discoverability principle. They signal to the user very clearly what actions are possible by the user on the website. This includes the calendar tab to view students upcoming assignment due dates. Then reminder section also helps with the discoverability principle by having bolded words in the notifications section that helps user with and without disabilities read and find it. </p>

                    <h1>Proposed Solution</h1>
                        <p align = "left"> We discovered issues of inefficiency of Athena, elc, and other UGA web services. We discussed and focused on how these issues affect teachers, students, and admins, particularly causing the most problems for students because students rely on these services the most and there are significantly more students than there are teachers and admins at UGA. Freshmen students are affected even more by these web issues because of the learning curve of a new technology. For all students, trying to create an outline of assignments for all classes for a semester is difficult to do because on elc each class must be accessed separately. In addition, elc lacks a convenient reminder system for assignments. This system affords limited convenience because it only gives reminders a couple days before the assignment is due, which does not encourage students to work on assignments ahead of time. Also, these reminders go out around the same time for multiple assignments, which could potentially cause a student to miss an important notification. This also affects professors too because it causes them to lose extra time if they choose to manually send out reminder emails to students. We propose that students should have a clear, concise outline of assignments with due dates that are auto-created on elc. We also noticed that it is not efficient to log in to Athena due to bugs that affect sessions, causing Athena to automatically log out when visited if the user did not explicitly log out during the last session. This causes inconvenience and forces users to reload the page manually. Once logged in to Athena, students are forced to navigate through several pages to simply view the semester schedule or other important pages. These login and navigation problems affect all students. This inefficiency hinders students’ studying time and wastes time that could be spent in more beneficial ways. We noticed that elc has not been updated and has not added new features since our class started at UGA around 2019. These web services lack convenient features and cause some issues for students, professors, and admin. Although the visual appearance and certain functionalities of Athena were updated over the last year, many students agree that Athena has become less convenient and more difficult to use since these updates.</p>
