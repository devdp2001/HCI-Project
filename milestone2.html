                    <h1>Task/Problem Definition</h1>
			<br><p>The eLearning Commons (eLC) is the online learning management system for the University of Georgia. Students and professors use this web or mobile application nearly everyday to view course content, assignments, grades, and course updates. 
			<br><br>We found our main problem with eLC's assignment calendar. Currently, eLC's assignment calendar is positioned near the bottom of the page on eLC's homepage. This calendar is not functional in any way when interacted with on the homepage. 
			<br><br>The calendar only holds some functionality when viewed on a specific course page. To do this users must login and click multiple buttons to navigate to a specific course they are taking. Here, the user can use the calendar but only to view upcoming assignments for that specific course. 
			<br><br>We found issues with this because we realized that eLC does not afford any kind of summarized view or calendar for all courses at once. This issue forces students to manually check each course if they want to check upcoming deadlines. If a student wants to create a planner or agenda, they must check each course separately. We assume that many students are unwilling to take these extra steps - meaning that many students never create any type of planner or agenda for course assignments. 
			<br><br>A solution to the calendar issues would benefit all students by making them feel comfortable that they haven't missed any assignment updates and encouraging students to work ahead on assignments because they are able to see the deadlines ahead of time. Professors benefit from a potential solution because they would feel more comfortable that students are staying updated on assignments without needing a reminder email from professors.
			<br><br>This problem is theme-relevant because eLC is the online learning management system for the University of Georgia and has similarities to the online learning management systems at many other universities.
<br><br>7 Stages of Action Example:
<br>Goals
<br>Goal: A user wants to view all upcoming assignments for all courses on eLC.

<br><br>Execution
<br>Plan: A user logs on to eLC and looks for a convenient view of all upcoming assignments, but there is none.
<br>Specify: The user looks for other options and decides to view a specific course.
<br>Perform: The user moves their mouse to and clicks on a specific course.
<br>World: At this point, the user can see upcoming assignments for a specific course.

<br><br>Evaluation
<br>Perceive: The user sees upcoming assignments for a single course.
<br>Interpret: The user may feel frustrated that they have to navigate to each course separately to complete this goal. 
<br>Compare: The user is able to complete their goal, but would probably feel better about a simplified way to complete their goal.

    <section id="b">

                <div class="col-lg-12">
                    <h1>Analysis of Existing Solutions</h1>
			<br><p><b><u>Homepage Calendar</u></b>
			<br>There is a calendar on the homepage that shows upcoming events so students can plan ahead.
			<br><br><b>Pros:</b>
			<br>-It is nice for students to have the option to view their upcoming assignments from a calendar view.
			<br><b>Cons:</b>
            <br>-The calendar is essentially useless. The “Upcoming Events” tab never shows any upcoming assignments. Clicking on a day will change the “Upcoming Events” tab to “Events for {Month} {day}”, which also doesn’t show anything. This prevents students from having a summarized view or calendar for all courses at once.
            <br>-The calendar is poorly placed at the bottom of the homepage and has multiple drop down links to access information, it is hardly used by the students due to its bad design and poor visibility. 
            <br><br>As a result of the eLC calendar's poor functionality, students use 3rd party applications to keep track of assignments. These 3rd party applications include Google Calendar and the Apple calendar apps on iOS and macOS. While 3rd party calendar/scheduling applications help keep track of assignments, they create unnecessary steps that students must take by having to add them into these 3rd party applications.
            <br><p><b><u>Guidelines and Principles</u></b>
            <br>The calendar solution helps with the discoverability principle. It signals to the user very clearly what actions are possible by the user on the website. This includes the calendar tab to view students upcoming assignment due dates. 
            <br>The reminder section also helps with the discoverability principle by having important words in the notifications section in bold to help users with and without disabilities read and understand clearly.

                    <h1>Proposed Solution</h1>
                        <p align = "left"> We discovered issues of inefficiency of Athena, elc, and other UGA web services. We discussed and focused on how these issues affect teachers, students, and admins, particularly causing the most problems for students because students rely on these services the most and there are significantly more students than there are teachers and admins at UGA. Freshmen students are affected even more by these web issues because of the learning curve of a new technology. For all students, trying to create an outline of assignments for all classes for a semester is difficult to do because on elc each class must be accessed separately. In addition, elc lacks a convenient reminder system for assignments. This system affords limited convenience because it only gives reminders a couple days before the assignment is due, which does not encourage students to work on assignments ahead of time. Also, these reminders go out around the same time for multiple assignments, which could potentially cause a student to miss an important notification. This also affects professors too because it causes them to lose extra time if they choose to manually send out reminder emails to students. We propose that students should have a clear, concise outline of assignments with due dates that are auto-created on elc. We also noticed that it is not efficient to log in to Athena due to bugs that affect sessions, causing Athena to automatically log out when visited if the user did not explicitly log out during the last session. This causes inconvenience and forces users to reload the page manually. Once logged in to Athena, students are forced to navigate through several pages to simply view the semester schedule or other important pages. These login and navigation problems affect all students. This inefficiency hinders students’ studying time and wastes time that could be spent in more beneficial ways. We noticed that elc has not been updated and has not added new features since our class started at UGA around 2019. These web services lack convenient features and cause some issues for students, professors, and admin. Although the visual appearance and certain functionalities of Athena were updated over the last year, many students agree that Athena has become less convenient and more difficult to use since these updates.</p>
