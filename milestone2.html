                    <h1>Task/Problem Definition</h1>
			<br><p>The eLearning Commons (eLC) is the online learning management system for the University of Georgia. Students and professors use this web or mobile application nearly everyday to view course content, assignments, grades, and course updates. 
			<br><br>We found our main problem with eLC's assignment calendar. Currently, eLC's assignment calendar is positioned near the bottom of the page on eLC's homepage. This calendar is not functional in any way when interacted with on the homepage. 
			<br><br>The calendar only holds some functionality when viewed on a specific course page. To do this users must login and click multiple buttons to navigate to a specific course they are taking. Here, the user can use the calendar but only to view upcoming assignments for that specific course. 
			<br><br>We found issues with this because we realized that eLC does not afford any kind of summarized view or calendar for all courses at once. This issue forces students to manually check each course if they want to check upcoming deadlines. If a student wants to create a planner or agenda, they must check each course separately. We assume that many students are unwilling to take these extra steps - meaning that many students never create any type of planner or agenda for course assignments. 
			<br><br>A solution to the calendar issues would benefit all students by making them feel comfortable that they haven't missed any assignment updates and encouraging students to work ahead on assignments because they are able to see the deadlines ahead of time. Professors benefit from a potential solution because they would feel more comfortable that students are staying updated on assignments without needing a reminder email from professors.
			<br><br>This problem is theme-relevant because eLC is the online learning management system for the University of Georgia and has similarities to the online learning management systems at many other universities.
<br><br>7 Stages of Action Example:
<br>Goals
<br>Goal: A user wants to view all upcoming assignments for all courses on eLC.

<br><br>Execution
<br>Plan: A user logs on to eLC and looks for a convenient view of all upcoming assignments, but there is none.
<br>Specify: The user looks for other options and decides to view a specific course.
<br>Perform: The user moves their mouse to and clicks on a specific course.
<br>World: At this point, the user can see upcoming assignments for a specific course.

<br><br>Evaluation
<br>Perceive: The user sees upcoming assignments for a single course.
<br>Interpret: The user may feel frustrated that they have to navigate to each course separately to complete this goal. 
<br>Compare: The user is able to complete their goal, but would probably feel better about a simplified way to complete their goal.

                    <h1>Analysis of Existing Solutions</h1>
			<br><p><b><u>Homepage Calendar</u></b>
			<br>There is a calendar on the homepage that shows upcoming events so students can plan ahead.
			<br><br><b>Pros:</b>
			<br>-It is nice for students to have the option to view their upcoming assignments from a calendar view.
			<br><b>Cons:</b>
            <br>-The calendar is essentially useless. The “Upcoming Events” tab never shows any upcoming assignments. Clicking on a day will change the “Upcoming Events” tab to “Events for {Month} {day}”, which also doesn’t show anything. This prevents students from having a summarized view or calendar for all courses at once.
            <br>-The calendar is poorly placed at the bottom of the homepage and has multiple drop down links to access information, it is hardly used by the students due to its bad design and poor visibility. 
            <br><br>As a result of the eLC calendar's poor functionality, students use 3rd party applications to keep track of assignments. These 3rd party applications include Google Calendar and the Apple calendar apps on iOS and macOS. While 3rd party calendar/scheduling applications help keep track of assignments, they create unnecessary steps that students must take by having to add them into these 3rd party applications.
            <br><p><b><u>Guidelines and Principles</u></b>
            <br>The calendar solution helps with the discoverability principle. It signals to the user very clearly what actions are possible by the user on the website. This includes the calendar tab to view students upcoming assignment due dates. 
            <br>The reminder section also helps with the discoverability principle by having important words in the notifications section in bold to help users with and without disabilities read and understand clearly.

                    <h1>Proposed Solution</h1>
			<p align = "left">Based on the problems mentioned in part A above, we propose a calendar that is positioned at a better location on the eLC homepage, and that shows the upcoming assignments for all classes that are due that week. 
In order for this to be successful, the student also should view the calendar on the eLC homepage to view their upcoming due assignments. These are the basic expectations, when all of this has been met then it would be up to the students to fulfill the task they are being reminded about. When all of these are met then success can be measured such that we may or may not see a clear boost to their grades which may be associated with them doing their assignments on time and not just rushing through them because they didn't see all of their upcoming assignments clearly before this solution was created.
