                    <h1>Testing Protocol</h1><br>
                        <p>1. <b>What is your research question?</b> It should be simple, falsifiable, and related to 
                            the effectiveness of your design in solving your problem of study.<br>
                            Can ELC’s calendar be improved by placing it above the fold and incorporating color?<br><br>
                            
                            <b>What methodology will you use for testing and why?</b><br>
                            To ensure accurate testing results, we want to use two methodologies for testing.<br><br>
                            
                            Our first method is practical, simple, and useful for testing the user experience of 
                            existing eLC users. For a fixed period of time until we are satisfied with the results, we 
                            will include a 1 question survey near the top of eLC's homepage. When a user logs in, they 
                            will be able to provide their answer to our question "do you like the recent changes to eLC's 
                            homepage and calendar?" Yes or no answer buttons will be provided but users will not be forced to participate. 
                            They will also be able to close the survey popup window without providing an answer.<br><br>
                            
                            Our second method will observe the impact of our changes through two experimental groups consisting of random 
                            high school seniors or recent high school graduates (participants that have never used eLC before). Students in both groups 
                            will be asked to navigate through eLC to find course information using the calendar and other UI. Group 1 will use the current 
                            version of eLC and Group 2 will use our new prototype of eLC. After completing the assigned task, both groups will complete 
                            a short survey to rate their experience, ease of use, and task completion satisfaction. Procedure (2 sample T-Test):<br><br>
                            - Take a random sample of 100 students (p1)<br>
                            &nbsp - Each student uses old elc calendar for at least 30 seconds when they use elc<br>
                            &nbsp - Students rate the calendar 1 or 0 (satisfactory = 1, unsatisfactory = 0)<br>
                            - Take another random sample of 100 students (p2)<br>
                            &nbsp - Each student uses new elc calendar for at least 30 seconds when they use elc<br>
                            &nbsp - Students rate the calendar 1 or 0 (satisfactory = 1, unsatisfactory = 0)<br><br>
                            
                            - Hypotheses<br>
                            &nbsp - Null: p1 - p2 = 0<br>
                            &nbsp - Alternative: p1 - p2 < 0<br>
                            &nbsp - P1 = tally of satisfactory / total students in p1<br>
                            &nbsp - P2 = tally of satisfactory / total students in p2<br><br>
                            
                            - Calculate the test statistic and find the p-value. Compare p-value against an alpha of 0.05.<br>
                            &nbsp - We expect the p-value to be less than 0.05, which will reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the new UI is better.<br><br>
