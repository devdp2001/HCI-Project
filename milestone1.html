			<p>We discovered issues of inefficiency of Athena, elc, and other UGA web services. We discussed and focused on how these issues affect teachers, students, and admins, particularly causing the most problems for students because students rely on these services the most and there are significantly more students than there are teachers and admins at UGA. Freshmen students are affected even more by these web issues because of the learning curve of a new technology. For all students, trying to create an outline of assignments for all classes for a semester is difficult to do because on elc each class must be accessed separately. In addition, elc lacks a convenient reminder system for assignments. This system affords limited convenience because it only gives reminders a couple days before the assignment is due, which does not encourage students to work on assignments ahead of time. Also, these reminders go out around the same time for multiple assignments, which could potentially cause a student to miss an important notification. This also affects professors too because it causes them to lose extra time if they choose to manually send out reminder emails to students. We propose that students should have a clear, concise outline of assignments with due dates that are auto-created on elc. We also noticed that it is not efficient to log in to Athena due to bugs that affect sessions, causing Athena to automatically log out when visited if the user did not explicitly log out during the last session. This causes a very unsmooth transition and forces users to reload the page manually. Once logged in to Athena, students are forced to navigate through several pages to simply view the semester schedule or other important pages. These login and navigation problems affect all students. This inefficiency hinders studentsâ€™ studying time and wastes time that could be spent in more beneficial ways. We noticed that elc has not been updated and has not added new features since our class started at UGA around 2019. These web services lack convenient features and cause some issues for students, professors, and admin. Although the visual appearance and certain functionalities of Athena were updated over the last year, many students agree that Athena has become less convenient and more difficult to use since these updates.</p>
